## Overview

The **e-Education** project is a modern web application designed to enhance the online education experience. This platform offers a seamless and interactive learning environment, utilizing a robust technology stack with a focus on scalability and performance.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Built with React.js, the frontend provides a responsive and engaging experience for users.
- **RESTful API**: The backend is powered by Express.js, delivering a fast and efficient server-side architecture.
- **Database Integration**: Data is managed and stored using MongoDB, with Mongoose as the ORM for creating and managing schemas.
- **API Testing**: APIs are tested and documented using Postman to ensure reliability and performance.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from React to the backend.

### Backend
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
- **Mongoose**: A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing application data.

### API Testing
- **Postman**: A powerful tool for API development and testing.
